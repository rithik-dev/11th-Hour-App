# 11th Hour

11th Hour is a mobile application in flutter to provide easily accessible college-specific study material,resources and video lectures a night before the exam to the students.
Students can login/sign up, buy courses, add them to cart, wishlist courses, search courses. The profile screen allows them to edit profile details and see transactions history.
The application uses razorpay for the payment gateway and firebase to store the courses and user authentication.

Students can upload courses which gives them an opportunity to make a quick buck along with studies. The courses can be uploaded using the [Web Portal](https://github.com/sarcastic-verma/11th_hour)

Via this platform, we aim to reach as many colleges as possible to help them earn a quick buck and at the 11th hour!
